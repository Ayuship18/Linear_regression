#Linear Regression: Different approaches

This repository demonstrates my understanding of linear regression by building it in multiple ways:

1. **Gradient Descent** - implemented from scratch in Python
2. **Normal Equation** — solving the regression coefficients analytically using linear algebra
3. **Library Functions** — using prebuilt methods (e.g., ISLP, scikit-learn).

Each approach is in its own folder with explanations and code.
